# QuizMe


## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a user compatible quiz that displayed questions one after another. For when the user selected a wrong answer time would be deducted. At the end the user should be able to enter their score and initials and store the information to local storage. However that function is currently unavailable.

### Codes 
HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery

### How to Use 
Upon opening the page instructions will be displayed/ after hitting start quiz button the time will start and the questions will be appeared.
